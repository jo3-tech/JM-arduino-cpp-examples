Useful examples and algorithm implementations for the Arduino platform.

This repository is a collection of examples, usually written during feasibility studies for the implementation of a library or project.

## accelerate-stepper-motor-aryeh-eiderman-04-algorithm

An example to illustrate how to accelerate a stepper motor using the algorithm presented in:
‘Real Time Stepper Motor Linear Ramping Just by Addition and Multiplication’ 2004, a paper by Aryeh Eiderman.

## accelerate_stepper_motor_david_austin_05_algorithm

An example to illustrate how to accelerate a stepper motor using the algorithm presented in:
‘Embedded Systems Programming’ January 2005, ‘Generate stepper-motor speed profiles in real time’, an article by David Austin.

## example/accelerate-stepper-motor-joseph-morgridge-24-algorithm

An example to illustrate how to accelerate a stepper motor using an algorithm developed based on the equations;
v = u + at and s = ut + 1/2at^2
These are simplified based on the conditions under which the algorithm is implemented on a microcontroller.
